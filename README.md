# ![BedrockAPI Logo](/logo.png "Logo")

Welcome to Bedrock API's wiki page! Bedrock API is a suite of extensible systems coordinated by Bedrock Core. This project is intended to allow for modules implementing high level and low level abstractions, although the included modules are more focused on basic lower level abstractions.

Modules in BedrockAPI are subject to change, and are not guaranteed to have compatibility with earlier or later versions (Although we aim to whenever possible)

### Getting Started

### Modules  

The most important bundled modules are as follows:

#### Core  

Core is the most basic piece of Bedrock API. It is in charge of managing all other existing modules.  
It's main responsibilities include dependency, lifecycle, concurrency,  and time management, among other things.

#### Graphics  

Graphics is in charge of handling rendering using a retained mode rendering system commonly referred to as a scene graph. Unlike its HTML inspiration, however, it does not natively handle interaction.

#### Input  

Input is in charge of allowing for a simple way to make more rich interactive experiences, and to make it easier to share peripherals and to probe their state.  

It primarily does this by having a centralized and shared peripheral state.

### Get Involved!

Due to the nature of our hosting solution you cannot push your own solutions.  However, you are allowed to fork freely or host your own versions on other git services, as long as it's modified.

On the other hand, you can get to know me personally, and get a user on our server so you can ssh in. I strongly discourage this though.  

 [//]: # (You'd have to doxx me to do this one. Hence the discouragement. However I expose all options, bad or not)

### Future Goals

- [ ] Finish this wiki page

- [ ] Complete the core reference system.

- [X] Get a good nights rest.
